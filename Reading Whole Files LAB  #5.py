 #Opening File Handles and reading data from files
print('''
This Lab is about opening a file handle, and 
reading the whole file into a big string.

You can read a file line by line, or put the 
whole file in as a single string.  This is an example 
of reading the whole file using the file method: 
- file_handle.read() method
      ''')
# Challenge 1
# Find the index that will print "red pill"
# sudo wget -O text-flie-matrix.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimTheSTEAMClown/Python-Class-STEAM-Clown/refs/heads/main/text-file-matrix.txt
# sudo wget -O text-file-mail-very-short.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimTheSTEAMClown/Python-Class-STEAM-Clown/refs/heads/main/text-file-mail-very-short.txt
